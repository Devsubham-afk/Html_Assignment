    <p>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the Republic of India post-1947.<br> The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the country.</p>

#Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.
#Ans: HTML uses a system of "tags" to define the structure and layout of web pages. Tags are the building blocks of 
HTML documents and consist of angle brackets enclosing specific keywords. These tags provide instructions to 
web browsers on how to display the content.An HTML tag is composed of an opening tag and, in some cases, a closing tag. 
The opening tag starts with the less-than symbol (<), followed by the tag name, and ends with a greater-than symbol (>). 
The closing tag is similar, but it also includes a forward slash (/) before the tag name.
Elements:An "element," on the other hand, consists of the opening tag, content, and closing tag that define a particular 
section of content on a webpage.
#Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--the below opening and closing tag of p shows the element-->
    <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
</body>
</html>

#What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?
#Ans: We start the file with `<!DOCTYPE html>`. It tells the browser what type of document to 
expect; in this case it is an HTML document
 The <DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages 
correctly
 It must appear only once, at the top of the page(before HTML tag)
 The <DOCTYPE>  declaration is not case sensitive. We can write any of the following, it does not give any 
error.
